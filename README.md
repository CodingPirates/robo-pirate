## Robo pirate
I am the robot servant for the [Coding Pirates][https://Codingpirates.dk] slack
channel. My purpose is to aid in the communication for all the volunteers in
Coding Pirates.


### My tasks
Below you see a list of the task I either intend to learn or already can do.

- [ ]  **Post when new channel is created:** Once a new channel is created I
should post the name of the channel along with a link to it in the
#announcements channel.
- [ ] **Welcome new people:** Once a new user joins our slack they should be
greeted with a welcome message and instructions on how we use slack.
- [ ] **Check for profile description:** Since we are so many people in our
slack we want people to write their department in their profile. I will write
them a friendly reminder until they do it.
- [ ] **Decisions:** The board of Coding Pirates uses slack to make decision
between meetings. If people type ```bash
    @robo-pirate Vote [public | private] Should we give the bot more rum?.
I will create a new message and ask people to vote in the message thread.
If the decision reaches a majority vote I will post the vote results to a
google sheet. The [public| private] flag decides on if I post to a public or
private sheet.
